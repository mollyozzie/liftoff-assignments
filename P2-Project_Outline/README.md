# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a bird tracking log that will allow bird watchers to track the birds that they see in the wild.  Bird watchers will be able to login and add or delete a bird by species, behavior, time of day, and date seen.

This project was motivated by the fact that I enjoy bird watching and would like a way to keep track of the birds that I see and how often I see them.

### Features
User login:  Users will be able to login, either by creating accounts in the system, or by using a third-party authentication provider.

View bird list:  Users will be able to view a list of the birds that they have logged.

Add a bird:  Users will be able to add to their bird list by entering in a mixture of required (species) and optional (behavior, time of day, date) fields.

Delete a bird:  Users will be able to delete a bird they previously logged.

### Technologies
Java

Spring Boot

MySQL

Thymeleaf Templates

Bootstrap

### What I'll Have to Learn
For the login functionality, I will have to learn something new in either situation.  If I have users create accounts in the system, I’ll need to learn how to build a user authentication API to allow the user to register new users and login.  If I use a third-party authenticator, I will need to learn how OAuth 2.0 works.

I’ll also need to learn more about Bootstrap and some of its features when it comes to making the front end look nice.
